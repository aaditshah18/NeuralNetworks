# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks

Welcome to the Handwritten Digit Recognition project repository! This project focuses on building a neural network model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.6%, showcasing its efficacy in digit recognition tasks.

## Abstract

This project serves as a comprehensive tutorial for developing a robust handwritten digit classification model using neural networks. By leveraging the MNIST dataset, the tutorial guides users through preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and analysis stages, providing invaluable insights into the intricacies of digit recognition.

## Key Features

- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for neural network implementation
- Preprocesses data to normalize pixel values and reshape images
- Constructs a fully connected neural network model for digit classification
- Trains the model using the MNIST dataset
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrix
- Analyzes model errors to gain insights into misclassifications
- Provides a summary of the model's accuracy and capabilities
